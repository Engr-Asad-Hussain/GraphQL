# GraphQL
- GraphQL is an open source query language created by Facebook. Before GraphQL went open source in 2015, Facebook used it internally for their mobile applications since 2012, as an alternative to the common REST architecture. 
- It allows requests for specific data, giving clients more control over what information is sent. It eliminates overfetching problem involved with RESTful  architecture.
- A query language like GraphQL on the server-side and client-side lets the client decide which data it needs by making a single request to the server. Network usage was reduced dramatically for Facebookâ€™s mobile applications as a result, because GraphQL made it more efficient with data transfers.
- A GraphQL operation is either a query (read), mutation (write), or subscription (continuous read). Each of those operations is only a string that needs to be constructed according to the GraphQL query language specification.
